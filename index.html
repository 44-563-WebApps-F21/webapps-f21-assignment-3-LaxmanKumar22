        <h6>Geneva</h6>
        <p>Geneva, capital of Switzerland is located at the southwestern end of Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) at its junction with the Rhône River. 
            The city lies at an elevation of 1,230 feet (375 metres) in the centre of a natural basin encircled by mountains. 
            I had been to Geneva with my friends. I was mesmerized with the building and constructions. The city has moderate temperature with cool breeze. 
            We were <b>awestruck</b> at the lighting near the river. That was an <b>unforgettable</b> trip for us. </p>

            <h4>Kruskal's Algorithm</h4>
            <blockquote>
                Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. 
                If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree. 
                (A minimum spanning tree of a connected graph is a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the sum of the weights of all the edges in the tree is minimized. 
                For a disconnected graph, a minimum spanning forest is composed of a minimum spanning tree for each connected component)
                It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as in each step it adds the next lowest-weight edge that will not form a cycle to the minimum spanning forest.

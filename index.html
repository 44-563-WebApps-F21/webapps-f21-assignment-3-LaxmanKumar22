        <h6>Geneva</h6>
        <p>Geneva, capital of Switzerland is located at the southwestern end of Lake Geneva (Lac Léman) at its junction with the Rhône River. 
            The city lies at an elevation of 1,230 feet (375 metres) in the centre of a natural basin encircled by mountains. 
            I had been to Geneva with my friends. I was mesmerized with the building and constructions. The city has moderate temperature with cool breeze. 
            We were <b>awestruck</b> at the lighting near the river. That was an <b>unforgettable</b> trip for us. </p>
